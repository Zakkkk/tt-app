# Broad list of todos/ideas

1. Should we be rating activities?
2. maybe next to each activity it shows how much xp you get?
3. Have a task bar, where you can add tasks and see the ones that are generated.
4. Choose from task pool for the daily tasks
5. Can make your daily tasks have a different set of priorities with different rewards for completing the higher
   priority tasks
6. Can see the checked off tasks at the bottom of the tasks of today
7. Can swipe on a task to put it back in the task pool if not completed.
8. Can set one off events (not tasks i think) in the calendar, i.e a test
9. Need different categories for each task and can sort the tasks by the category. maybe add colours and icons
